# Machine_Learning_Projects
Few of the machine learning projects which I have developed as part of my Masters curriculum have been listed here.

## Correlation and impact of COVID19 on weather and exchange rate data
### Dataset Description
Dataset-1 COVID dataset (JSON):
Three REST API end points had been triggered using a python script to collect three different JSON which contains the COVID confirmed, recovered and mortality cases information of all the countries in the world starting from 22 January 2020 to 24 March 2020. Later, three collections got created under a mongo database called Covid. Each collection is capable of storing each JSON response. We had chosen these dates for our analysis since this is when the pandemic starts growing exponentially.

Dataset-2 Weather dataset (CSV) 
Weather dataset was taken from Kaggle an open source data repository which was in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. This file had around 10,000 rows with 12 columns which contains average weather and other climate descriptor details recorded for all the countries in the world from 22 January to 24 March 2020. 

Dataset-3 Exchange rate dataset (CSV) 
This dataset had been taken from  which contains the exchange rate fluctuations of all currencies in the world. This file was also in a CSV format. This dataset contains around 7000 rows with 6 columns which depicts the details about currency, the currency code and its exchange rate changes recorded from 22 January to 24 March 2020.
